\begin{myblock}{Introduction}

\textbf{Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the major mitigation measures to handle climate change. Even though international organisations agreed on the importance of CCS and the effective Paris Agreement refers to the widely accepted climate scenarios, the technology is not implemented on a large scale beyond pilot projects yet, nor are economic incentives given to foster its deployment. CCS is not a cutting-edge technology, the applied methods are well-known – not only in the oil and gas industry. Buzz words like enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) stir up hope to realise large-scale projects soon and in an economically viable way.}

The summer school \enquote{CCS in the High North} is a collaboration between the \textbf{University of Oslo} (UiO), the \textbf{Colorado School of Mines} (CSM) in Golden and the \textbf{University Centre in Svalbard} (UNIS). It offers a suite of lectures, exercises and geological field work on MSc and PhD level, which are credited with \textbf{13 ECTS}. A highly motivated group of international students with diverse backgrounds and specialisations were not only taught, but also engaged themselves in inspiring discussions.

%Unfortunately, in 2017 the course in Golden, Colorado had to be cancelled due to high political uncertainties and visa restrictions for international students.

\begin{myblock}{Fieldwork \& The Longyearbyen \ce{CO2} Lab}
Highlight of the Summer School were three days of fieldwork on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. The aim of the field investigations was to identify potential reservoir formations, evaluate and compare them on their ability to safely store \ce{CO2}. Beside two promising \ce{CO2} storage formations (see figures \ref{fig:fieldwork_adolfbukta} and \ref{fig:fieldwork_skansbukta}), also the targeted units of the Longyearbyen \ce{CO2} Lab were logged in the field close to Deltanesset. Tight sandstones with quartz-overgrowth and pore-filling clay minerals can be observed. Mudstone layers, a thrust décollement and lateral permafrost provide sufficient sealing (compare figure \ref{fig:cross_section}). Injection tests show secondary permeability caused by fractures and the sealing ability is proven by high underpressure in the reservoir \citep{braathen_longyearbyen_2012}.

			Comparison of porosity–depth trend studies and experimental results for shales and
argillaceous sediments. While for E\&P projects the seal integrity is proven by the abundance of hydrocarbons, for \ce{CO2} storage it remains uncertain. Controlling factors are clay mineral and pore fluid composition, grain sizes, pore pressure and the influence of mechanical \textbf{(MC)} and chemical compaction \textbf{(CC)}. Because core sampling of seal layers is expensive, experimental studies and global databases might be auxiliary. Still, extrapolation of experimental results has limited validity for natural anisotropy and the influence of chemical compaction \citep{mondol_experimental_2007}.

			Different leakage scenarios for a \ce{CO2} storage project which are subject to uncertainty. To prevent a spill out of the storage formation \textbf{(1)}, the storage capacity must be estimated. A break of \ce{CO2} through the formation's roof \textbf{(2)} depends on seal properties and knowledge of fracture pressures (see figure \ref{fig:compaction}). Evaluation of leakage along \textbf{(3)} or through \textbf{(4)} a fault requires the analysis of juxtaposition and smearing. Sub-seismic faults represent an additional risk. Still, the highest risk of leakage exists in close proximity to wells (Figure based on lecture notes, lecture by K. Indrevær \& A. Braathen, 15.6.2017).

\begin{myblock}{Outlook \& Motivation}
		\begin{minipage}[t]{0.72\textwidth}
			\vspace{0pt}
			Marco studies \textbf{Georesources Management} in Aachen. During his various stays in Norway -- two semesters in Stavanger and summer courses in Oslo and Longyearbyen -- he became passionate about \textbf{risk} and \textbf{decision analysis}. Currently he is writing his master thesis in the field of\textbf{ geologic modelling and uncertainty quantification} in exploration. His focus will be on the application of a \textbf{value of information (VOI)} approach. A specific project to test assumptions and models would be beneficial. The high potential of future \textbf{\ce{CO2} storage projects} provides a suitable case for application. The mentioned methods are believed to contribute to urgently needed \textbf{cost reduction} and \textbf{risk management} of CCS projects.

					As georesources manager who majored in geoscience I am curious about the structure and dynamics of our earth, but I like to put “these rocks” into a bigger picture. I am not only eager to understand what is going on below our feet, but also to estimate its value to society or economy and to communicate gained knowledge and accompanying risks to decision makers – in order to enable them to make good decisions.

Currently I am writing my master thesis in the field of geologic modelling and uncertainty quantification in exploration. My focus will be on the application of a value of information (VOI) approach and using open source software to demonstrate light weight solutions for high-cost projects.

I am looking for a specific project or data to test the mentioned methods on, preferably in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which I believe has a great potential mitigating the dramatic consequences of climate change.
