Dear IDEA-league Applied Geophysics MSc student,

the time has come for you to dive into the world of research.
In order for you to be able to focus fully on your research and to create unified IDEA-league output, we have developed a LaTeX template which should be used for writing your final MSc thesis.
Some guidelines:

* The main file is MSc_layout.tex. In this file, you will add the different chapters (chapter#.tex) in correct order to the workflow, you can change fundamental thesis information like the ‘title’, authors and supervisors, and refer to the correct reference file (MyBib.bib). In addition, acronyms can be defined here.

* In the title page and copyright statement logos of the three universities can be chosen. RWTH does not allow the use of logos in a master thesis report. You need to modify this to your choice in the class-file MScThesis.cls.

* Each chapter should be written as a different *.tex file, that will be linked in MSc_layout.tex

* The ‘List of Figures’, ‘List of Tables’ and ‘Index’ are optional. If you wish to use and print the ‘Index’, be sure you compile the index file separately as well (dependent on your LaTeX editor).

* chapter1.tex and chapter2.tex act as example files. Some LaTeX tips-and-tricks are explained in these chapters. The end-result of certain commands can be seen directly in the produced PDF.

* Throughout the example files, some additional hints and guidelines are provided behind the comment symbol ‘%’. In addition, the abstract and introduction sections contain guidelines how to write them. 

* The *.bib file contains all your references, in the correct format (including “).
This file needs to be compiled separately using the ‘bib-compile’ option of your LaTeX text editor (like TeXmaker). However, sometimes the bib-compile and MSc_layout compilation need to be run several times in order to display all references (and references to figures/tables/equations) correctly in the text. Always check your PDF after compilation and before final submission!

An easy to install LaTeX text editor is TeXmaker, which is fully operational on all platforms (http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). Alternatives are TeXniccenter, for Windows (http://www.texniccenter.org) and TeXworks for Mac (http://tug.org/mactex/).
More information on LaTeX and a quick tutorial for people that are not yet familiar with this amazing typesetting system can be found on: http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

Whenever you have a certain problem with LaTeX or a certain requirement for your LaTeX document, just browse the web; there is plenty of information and help available.

We wish you good luck and lots of fun with your MSc research and LaTeX!

Best regards,

Niels Grobbe
