@article{Cook2006,
	Abstract = {Projections of world energy demand indicate increasing use of fossil fuels, especially coal. Because of this there is interest in using carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies as a mitigation option, particularly in Australia because of its dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Research in Australia into capture options includes post-combustion capture (PCC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and oxyfuels combustion. Separation technologies being investigated in Australia include solvent absorption, membranes, adsorption and cryogenics, with particular emphasis on bringing down costs. Australia appears to have abundant geological storage capacity, particularly in saline formations and to a much lesser extent in depleted oil and gas fields. Storage in coal systems has potential but more research and development is needed. Australia has the opportunity to use low-emission hubs in order to bring down costs. A major study of this concept for the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, based on 50 million tonnes per annum of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, is encouraging. A key concept for taking CO<sub>2</sub> capture and geological storage forward is demonstration and commercial deployment. Australian projects are proposed for PCC and oxyfuels combustion. A significant geological storage project has started in the Otway Basin, with CO<sub>2</sub> injection scheduled to commence in mid-2007. The coal-to-liquids Monash Project could involve up to 10 million tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> per annum, with injection into the offshore Gippsland Basin. The most advanced commercial project is the LNG Gorgon Project, comprising about 3 million tonnes per annum. Through current R&amp;D momentum and the likelihood of a number of major commercial-scale projects, Australia could become an early mover in the application of carbon dioxide capture and geological storage.},

Furthermore, multiple gridblocks can be assigned to specific subregions of the model domain, which are characterized by constant parameter values, further reducing the number of parameters to be estimated. This process is referred to as zonation.

Page 23
heterogeneity can be described by geostatistical methods, in which the spatial variability is characterized by a relatively small number of geostatistical parameters

Page 23
The reduction of the number of parameters from infinity to a finite dimension n is called parameterization [Yeh, 1986]

Page 23
parameters estimated by inverse modeling are always model-related.


Page 45
Gradient-Based Methods: [...] Updating the parameter vector in small steps along the search direction determined by the gradient is a robust, albeit inefficient, procedure. Various modifications of this basic scheme have been proposed. Their main difference lies in the choice of an appropriate step length.

Page 46
Second Derivative Methods: Thesemethodsare basedontheHessianmatrixorvarious approximations thereof (quasi-linearization). They perform well for nearly linear least-squares problems.

@article{Rahmanian1990,
	Abstract = {The Gippsland Basin is Australia's most prolific oil and gas province, with initial reserves estimated at 3.6 billion barrels crude/condensate, 0.6 billion barrels liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and 8.3 TCF dry gas. It is located in southeastern Australia, mainly offshore. Significant hydrocarbons were first discovered in 1964, in large structures at the top of the Late Cretaceous-Eocene Latrobe Group. All of the large structures have now been drilled, with current exploration concentrating on fault-dependent and combined stratigraphic structural traps within the Latrobe Group. Hydrocarbon, source rock and maturation data suggest that there is a widespread and uniform non-marine source of Late Cretaceous age. The concentration of hydrocarbons at the top of the Latrobe Group is due to the presence of large structures, an excellent cap seal, and the relatively sandy nature of the underlying, intra-Latrobe section. The distribution of oil versus gas at this level is largely explained by maturation variations and migration pathways within the basin. Vertical migration of up to 2 km is required in most cases. The distribution of oil versus gas is also influenced by minor source rock variations, fresh water washing, biodegradation, and the variable quality of fault seal. Recent exploration studies have concentrated on locating stratigraphic and combination traps, especially within the Latrobe Group. Prediction and subsequent discovery of these traps is a challenging task that has been aided by sequence-stratigraphic and seismic-stratigraphic analysis of the rock record. This has allowed the prediction of reservoir, source and seal geometries and distributions. The techniques used to construct this chronostratigraphic framework are presented, together with examples of its application within fields and on a regional basis.},

	Annote = {Good overview of geological uncertainties and the comparison between geological and parametric uncertainties;
"However, the geological model becomes crucial in situa- tions, where groundwater models are used for extrapolation be- yond the calibration base, e.g., for transport predictions or for predictions of the effects of future changes in abstraction or cli- mate, when only head and discharge data for the present pumping situation or climate are available for calibration. In such situations, the geological structure uncertainty may often be the dominant source of uncertainty."
"The geological model has always been recognized as a very important element in groundwater modeling"
"Our experience suggests that use of more formalized methodologies for constructing stochastic geological models from basic geological and geostatistical knowledge, e.g., TProGS [23] or similar, may be a promising way forward'
"It is clear from our studies that all three main sources of geolog- ically related uncertainty, i.e., geological structures, effective parameters and local scale heterogeneity, will significantly influ- ence prediction uncertainty in groundwater modeling. The relative weight of the three sources of uncertainty will vary from case to case depending on the hydrogeological system, the data availabil- ity and the types of model predictions. As argued by Neuman and Wierenga [38], all three sources of uncertainty should be consid- ered. This can be done by exploring the effects of parameter uncer- tainty and local scale heterogeneity for a number of alternative geological models and then assess the joint uncertainty by use of Bayesian Model Averaging. We have not done so in our previous studies, and we are not aware of case studies where this has been done explicitly, so this is an impending challenge."
