\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1-3}{\ignorespaces In (a), a structural trap resulting from the combination of 4-way anticlinal closure and a simple normal fault is illustrated. The two reservoir layers in both sides are juxtaposed, so that the hydrocarbon accumulation potential is controlled by three points of possible leak pathways: (1) the anticlinal spill point, (2) leakage upwards along the fault and (3) leakage across the fault enabled by the juxtaposition. Possibilities (2) and (3) depend on the transport properties of the fault zone, i.e. potential fault sealing. Given leakage along the fault (2), that size volume would be reduced to a small relatively small volume solely defined by the 4-way closure down to maximum contact of the reservoir-seal boundary with the fault plane. In case (b), the reservoirs are not juxtaposed and thus laterally sealed. Fault-related leakage can thus only occur along the plane. Leakage along and across the fault is enabled by the juxtaposition in (c) (modified from \citet {van2003lateral}).\relax }}{12}{figure.caption.9}
